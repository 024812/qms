# QMS Architecture Review Plan

This document outlines the plan for a comprehensive architecture review of the QMS project.

## 1. Overall System Architecture Review
- **Objective:** Evaluate the high-level architecture, including the separation of concerns, repository structure, and containerization strategy.
- **Key Areas:**
    - Frontend (Vue.js) and Backend (FastAPI) separation.
    - Monolithic repository approach.
    - Docker for containerization.
- **Success Criteria:** A clear understanding of the pros and cons of the current architecture.

## 2. Backend Architecture Review
- **Objective:** Assess the backend implementation, including the framework, database interaction, and project structure.
- **Key Areas:**
    - FastAPI for API development.
    - SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
    - Pydantic for data validation.
    - Project structure (routers, services, models).
- **Success Criteria:** Identification of any potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement in the backend.

## 3. Frontend Architecture Review
- **Objective:** Evaluate the frontend implementation, including the framework, state management, and UI components.
- **Key Areas:**
    - Vue.js 3 for the user interface.
    - Pinia for state management.
    - Vue Router for navigation.
    - Element Plus for UI components.
- **Success Criteria:** A clear understanding of the frontend architecture and its scalability.

## 4. Database Design Review
- **Objective:** Review the database schema and its design.
- **Key Areas:**
    - Table relationships.
    - Data types.
    - Indexing strategies.
- **Success Criteria:** Identification of any potential issues with the database design.

## 5. Deployment Strategy Review
- **Objective:** Assess the deployment strategy and its effectiveness.
- **Key Areas:**
    - Docker-based deployment.
    - `docker-compose.yml` for orchestration.
- **Success Criteria:** A clear understanding of the deployment process and its reliability.

## 6. Actionable Recommendations
- **Objective:** Provide a list of actionable recommendations for improvement.
- **Key Areas:**
    - Scalability.
    - Maintainability.
    - Performance.
- **Success Criteria:** A clear, prioritized list of recommendations.
