# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project uses npm-compatible date-based semantic versions in `YYYY.M.D` form.

## [2026.4.2] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Standardized `quilts` and `cards` around a copyable module blueprint pattern in:
  - `src/modules/core/blueprint.ts`
  - `src/modules/quilts/blueprint.ts`
  - `src/modules/cards/blueprint.ts`
- Locked module architecture around canonical data files in `src/lib/data/*.ts`, canonical server actions in `src/app/actions/*.ts`, and server-page-shell plus client-shell boundaries under `src/app/[locale]/**`.
- Continued moving internal module reads and writes away from legacy repository-first and REST-first paths.
- Updated README documentation to match the real production stack: Next.js 16.2, React 19.2, Auth.js v5, Drizzle ORM, Neon, React Query wrappers, and Vercel deployment.

### Fixed

- Stabilized settings and dashboard data flow so server and client state no longer drift across fallback code paths.
- Prevented build-time database noise on `/[locale]/settings` by forcing the page onto the proper runtime connection path.
- Cleared remaining lint and type debt in the current release baseline.

### Module Architecture

- Quilts now act as the first canonical module template with a single DAL, a single actions surface, server-first pages, and tag-based cache invalidation.
- Cards are aligned to the same model across list, detail, sold, overview, and settings flows.
- Internal application flows now treat route handlers primarily as compatibility surfaces instead of the main truth layer.

### Release

- Bumped version from `2026.2.21` to `2026.4.2`.

  - `npm run lint:check`
  - `npm run type-check`
